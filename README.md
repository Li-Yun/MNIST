# MNIST

This digit recognition program is written by C++, and it is a simple multilayer neural network
classification system that uses mini-batch gradient descent to execute learning process during
training stage. Please follow the instructions to compile the program and execute the program: <br />

1. Compile The Program: <br />
before running the digit classification program, we have to compile the program correctly. Please
use the following command to compile this program: <br />

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp NeuralNetwork.cpp -o file_name <br />

For example: <br />

g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp NeuralNetwork.cpp -o output <br />

2. Execute The Program: <br />
after compiling the program, we are able to apply two different commands to execute different functions. 
In the folder, there are two pre-trained weights, so users can directly utilize these two weightâ€™s models 
to test classification accuracy. Alternatively, users can run training function in the program to generate 
new weights and apply new weights to do testing stage. <br />

2.1: The command for training neural network: <br />

./output run [N_neurons LR max_iter size_mini-batch] <br />

For example: <br />
./output run 128 0.3 30 10 <br />

2.2: The command for testing neural network: <br />

./output testing [N_neurons] <br />

Ex: <br />
./output testing 128 <br />

where N_neurons:  the number of neurons in the hidden layer. <br />
      LR:  learning rate. <br />
      max_iter:  maximum iteration <br />
      size_mini-batch:  the size of mini-batch <br />
